LCA.java is the source code for solving the LCA problem in a binary tree.
LCATest.java is the JUnit test code for the methods in LCA.java.

LCA.java and LCATest.java should be opened and tested in a Eclipse java project, under the default package in src folder, and project initiated with javaSE 1.8 standard library. The JUnit 4 library should also be included as well.

Some tests in LCATest.java fail because the solution in LCA.java cannot cope with those situations as it only records one possible route from root node to target node.
